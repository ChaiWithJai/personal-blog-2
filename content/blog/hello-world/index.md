Shower thought...

Why do we start every example when learning JS "hello world"?

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

We use "Hello, world!" as a was to introduce novices to a programming language. The phrase was initially used as a quick way to test if a program works. It's a much faster way to test than trying to think of random words and sentences on the spot.

The "Hello, world!" phrase was first used in 1972 by Bell Labs from an internal memo sent by Brain Kernighan who wrote Programming in C:  A Tutorial (published in 1973).

But why, "Hello, world!"

In an interview with ([Forbes India](http://www.forbesindia.com/interview/special/brian-kernighan-no-one-thought-c-would-become-so-big/29982/1#ixzz20uGsw1jH)) Kernighan said he doesn't really remember... but from what he can recall, he saw a cartoon that showed an egg and a chick and the chick was saying, "Hello, World."

Before C other in programming languages like FORTRAN and BASIC, examples would be based on calculus and "MY HUMAN UNDERSTANDS ME."

If you'd like to learn more about the history of "Hello, world." you should seriously reconsider your priorities and move onto something else.
